        advanceFrame():
            Get the next animation frame for the sprite

            A one line function to add to the y coord of the sprite. I made it a function because
            I think future version may have a more complex way of applying gravity.
        chooseAnimation():
            Chooses proper animation based on which keys are pressed and what state the sprite is in.
            Pretty basic right now, but again, I'm looking into the future ... into the year .... 2000! (sorry Conan Obrian joke)
        handlePlatformCollision(platform):
            Game loop sends platorm reference on collision. This method decides what to do. Basically adjusts player position
            based on current state.
        jump():
            You guess.
        movePlayer():
            Based on current state and player location, this method actually updates player position.
        setAnimation(key):
            Choose animation by key (e.g. up, down, left, right)
            This version we only walk up down left right, but future could have: duck, jump, shoot , etc. etc. etc. 
        update()

class StateManager(object):
    """ StateManager allows you to register a state (falling, jumping, static, whatever) and then switch between 
        them to help control behaviors. 
        
        This may be overkill, but I thought in the big picture it could help with game decisions. For example:
            CurrentState: Falling 
            Event: player pushes the left arrow
            Result: don't update postion, player is ... falling
        I know we had some semblence of this in our player class, but again I may have over engineered this one. 
        BUT! Debugging has been harder than we are used to. I also wrote this class as a type of "debug" helper. 
        It logs every state change with the pygame clock. In real life, we could enhance this to find bugs in our
        code! 
        Also, it reads better in the player class!
